# ToP_LandingPage
The Odin Project landing page project as part of the foundations path

## About
The aim of this project was to utilise what had been learnt so far to create a fundamental landing page. I chose to omit any extra content or updating it to any personalised content at this stage. The project makes use of what we have learnt in terms of basic CSS and HTML as well as the use of flexbox.
